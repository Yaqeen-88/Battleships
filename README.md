# Battleships

## Description
This project will be about battleships! the classic board game, but with a special theme! when the game starts, the enemies will be distributed on the board randomly. There are 5 enemies, each would take different amount of spaces on the board (from 1 to 5 spaces). You need to find the enemies with the least amount of misses. There will be a scoreboard that records hits, misses, and total shots.
